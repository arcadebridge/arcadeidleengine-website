# **ARCADE IDLE ENGINE** User Manual

## Quickstart

> [!WARNING]

If you are creating a new project, then make sure to switch the build target to mobile (Android/iOS) and then import the DOTween. Asset contains Odin Serializer which requires the project to be in `.Net Framework` instead of `.Net Standard`.

After importing the asset, you will see two scenes. **Showcase** scene is all about showing all the features in the most straightforward way while **Sample Game** scene tries to replicate a typical Arcade Idle game scenario. You can find both of the scenes under the directory:
> ArcadeIdleEngine/Demo/_Scenes/


In the next section, we’ll explain what every script parameter do, so you have better understand overall. If you are still confused, analyze scenes and prefabs to understand how they work. I did my best to simplify as much as possible but because it's an Arcade Idle genre, it gets quite complicated pretty easily.
